# Web-Phishing-Detection

Web phishing detection using deep learning involves leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, specifically deep neural networks, to identify and combat phishing attacks on the web. Phishing is a form of cyber attack where malicious actors attempt to deceive users into providing sensitive information such as passwords, credit card details, or personal data by posing as legitimate entities.

Deep learning models, such as deep neural networks, are particularly effective in this domain due to their ability to automatically learn complex patterns and features from vast amounts of data. The detection process typically involves the following steps:

#### ***Data Collection: A large dataset of legitimate and phishing websites is collected. Legitimate websites are obtained from reliable sources, while known phishing websites are obtained from security organizations, blacklists, or user reports.***

#### ***Feature Extraction: Relevant features are extracted from the collected websites. These features can include the URL structure, domain information, webpage content, HTML tags, and other contextual information.***

#### ***Training the Deep Learning Model: The extracted features, along with their corresponding labels (phishing or legitimate), are used to train a deep learning model. This typically involves constructing a neural network architecture suitable for the task, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN).***

#### ***Model Training and Validation: The model is trained on the collected dataset, with the goal of minimizing the classification error. Training involves adjusting the model's parameters through iterative optimization algorithms, such as stochastic gradient descent, and validating its performance using separate validation data to avoid overfitting.***

#### ***Phishing Detection: Once the model is trained and validated, it can be deployed to detect phishing attacks in real-time. When a user visits a website, the system extracts relevant features from the website and feeds them into the trained model. The model then predicts whether the website is legitimate or phishing based on its learned patterns and features.***

Web phishing detection using deep learning offers several advantages over traditional rule-based or signature-based approaches. Deep learning models have the ability to generalize from learned patterns, making them effective at detecting new and previously unseen phishing attacks. Additionally, they can adapt and improve their performance over time through continuous training on updated datasets.
